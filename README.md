# 🎬 cgv-bot

A telegram chatbot that automates interaction with CGV Yongsan, which has the largest IMAX screen in South Korea.
It checks seat availability based on your selected date and movie, and displays the number of remaining seats along with movie schedule.
I made this bot for myself to book the best seat of IMAX and watch Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning.
